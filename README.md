# CS_561_Database
Here we have one table called as the Sales table. We write SQL queries and fetch data from the sales table. The same queries are also written in Java.

Use the load_sales_table.sql to create the sales table. After creating the sales table load the sales table.

Database: I have used PostgreSQL version 4 to write the sql queries. Download postgreSQL from here https://www.postgresql.org/.

Java Code: The IDE which I have used is Eclipse. Before executing the Java code you must import the jars for postgresql.
